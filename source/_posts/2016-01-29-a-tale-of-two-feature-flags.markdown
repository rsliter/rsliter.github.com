I spoke at RubyConf last fall about feature flags and tech debt. Here's
the abstract:

>> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Feature flags
>> are a quick win for development teams seeking a way to more rapidly
>> release software but can create unexpected technical complexity. Join
>> us for a comparison of the life-cycles of two seemingly similar
>> feature flags. We'll discuss the challenges teams often face when
>> implementing them, as well as strategies to avoid these issues and
>> deliver software quickly and reliably.

If that sounds interesting, [you can watch the talk
