<strong>1</strong> Morning spent cycling on the runway of Quito's old airport.

<strong>1</strong> Church (Catholic), ascended by foot all the way to the bell tower.

<strong>2</strong> Cold springs swum in.

<strong>4</strong> Ominous stomach rumblings (between the two of us), signaling
that our choice of restaurant was perhaps not the most sound.

<strong>Infinite</strong> Discussions about finally signing up for a salsa
dancing class.

We've taken advantage of minor illness and [general busy-ness]({{ root_url}}/blog/2013/09/27/programacion-funcional-con-scala/) to stick close to our home base and explore Quito. Hopefully soon we'll venture a little further outside the city but it's been a treat to explore all the churches, outdoor activities, and pastries Quito has to offer.
