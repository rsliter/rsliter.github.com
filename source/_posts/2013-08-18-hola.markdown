I've been in Ecuador for about three weeks, in which time I've 
helped plan our [start-of-office](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=637562259600702&set=a.243430865680512.67637.117154494974817&type=1&theater) immersion program, delivered [a presentation](https://twitter.com/fmrtn/status/364099758173868032) on software testing *en Espa√±ol* and visited
Mindo, a small town in the jungle about two hours outside of Quito.

The content of this brand-new blog will likely touch on the
above-mentioned subjects (that is, a thrilling mix of hiking and software), but for now I'll leave y'all with a photo of the
park near my apartment, where I attempted my first-ever high-altitude run
this past weekend.
