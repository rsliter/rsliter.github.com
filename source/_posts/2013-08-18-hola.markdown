I've been in Ecuador for about three weeks, in which time I've managed
to help plan our start-of-office immersion program, deliver a
presentation on software testing in Spanish and visit
Mindo, a small town in the jungle about two hours outside of Quito.

While in Mindo, we rode a truck-engine powered gondola over the forest,
arriving on the other side of the gorge for a hike through the forest. 

We also saw hummingbirds.
