When I moved to Ecuador a few months ago I needed to learn Spanish quickly. Being surrounded by the language has been a great help; however, there are ways to fake
the immersion experience. I've shared some of the tricks I used to learn
Spanish within my first month here.

<strong>Start here: Duolingo</strong>
To improve quickly I needed to practice speaking with others, a terrifying prospect. I can't recommend [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/) highly enough, despite criticisms of its nonsensical phrases seemingly lacking real-world application\*. The app's combination of drilling and silliness helped me overcome my fear of speaking Spanish with others.

<strong>Think about it</strong>
It's said that dreaming in a language indicates fluency. Though I
haven't yet dreamt in Spanish, I'm getting closer by forcing
translations of my thoughts.

Do I have a song in my head? Can I fumble through its translation, however rudimentary? Probably. When cooking, I translate the recipe in my while prepping the food. This gives me plenty of time to mull over potential translations.

<strong>Google translate is your BFF</strong>
All those nerdy songs I was translating in my head? That time I didn't
know how to say *eggplant* in Spanish? I looked it up on Google
translate. Syntax-wise it's not perfect but I generally trust it for
single-word translations.

<strong>*El hombre-araña sube la rascacielo*</strong>
Once I'd learn a word I'd force myself to use it in a sentence. Once again, the
sillier, the better: outlandish sayings stay in my head precisely because
they're different.

<strong>Make it fun</strong>
I built a [quick Angular app](http://conjuegen-verbos.herokuapp.com/app/index.html#/verbos) one day to quiz myself on translations. It didn't take much time to build and was fun to play with, and show off around the office, for an
afternoon. The more I incorporated Spanish into everyday activities the faster I reinforced vocabulary.

<strong>Write it down!</strong>
I've had plenty of opportunities to write emails in Spanish for work (with gratuitous
use of Google translate, of course). I'd recommend just taking the time to write
something down in the language you're learning. It's another way to
practice using whole sentences and phrases with a real audience--
without the pressure of actually having to speak with that audience.

As is the case with learning anything there's no substitute for practice. However, the tricks
I've mentioned helped to make studying much more fun-- and therefore,
easier.
