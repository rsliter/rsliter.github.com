I'm a software engineering manager living in Brooklyn, New York. Some of the things that I care a lot about include:

* Growing teams: I have experience as a consultant coaching clients on software development and Agile practices.
* Coaching individuals: I've helped build mentoring programs for new employees (both for lateral hires and [those new to software development]({{ root_url}}/tacos/rails/talks/pecha%20kucha/tech/2013/09/02/rails-y-las-taquerias/)) and have [spent time]({{ root_url}}/tech/talks/scala/quito%20lambda/2013/09/27/programacion-funcional-con-scala/) in Quito, Ecuador [bootstrapping an office]({{root_url}}/team%20dynamics/2014/05/27/pushups).
* Engneering practices that enable teams to do their best work: I prioritize team effectiveness over individual output. Check out [this talk on feature flags]({{root_url}}/ruby/rubyconf/feature%20flags/2016/01/29/a-tale-of-two-feature-flags/) I gave at RubyConf for more on that.

In the past I've worked as an Agile software consultant for companies of all shapes and sizes. I'm currently working at Kickstarter as an engineering manager on our growth team.

I've also got a cat named Wendy Davis:
