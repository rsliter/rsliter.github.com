I'm a software engineering manager at Etsy working on tools that help sellers get their creations in front of more prospective buyers. I live in Brooklyn, New York.

In the past I worked at Kickstarter as an engineer and manager on their Growth team. While there I gave [a talk at Rubyconf]({{root_url}}/ruby/rubyconf/feature%20flags/2016/01/29/a-tale-of-two-feature-flags/) about feature flags and the importance of engneering practices that enable teams to do their best work. Before Kickstarter I'd only worked as consultant, so I learned a TON about what it meant to work for a product organization.

I worked as a software developer consultant at ThoughtWorks, where I helped organizations large and small build custom software. While there, I spent some time in Quito, Ecuador, helping grow a new office for the company. I built mentoring programs for new employees (both for lateral hires and [those new to software development]({{ root_url}}/tacos/rails/talks/pecha%20kucha/tech/2013/09/02/rails-y-las-taquerias/)) and [helped grow the tech community there]({{ root_url}}/tech/talks/scala/quito%20lambda/2013/09/27/programacion-funcional-con-scala/).

I've also got a cat named Wendy Davis:
