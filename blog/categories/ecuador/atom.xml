<strong>1</strong> Morning spent cycling on the runway of Quito&rsquo;s old airport.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Church (Catholic), ascended by foot all the way to the bell tower.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Cold springs swum in.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Ominous stomach rumblings (between the two of us), signaling
that our choice of restaurant was perhaps not the most sound.</p>

<p><strong>Infinite</strong> Discussions about finally signing up for a salsa
dancing class.</p>

We&rsquo;ve taken advantage of minor illness and <a href="/blog/2013/09/27/programacion-funcional-con-scala/">general busy-ness</a> to stick close to our home base and explore Quito.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/pinchincha_welcome.jpg" /></p>

<p>I remember one the outdoor companies in my college town had a slogan,
“Get High in the Mountains,” ostensibly owing to both the altitude
(a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone,_North_Carolina#Geography_and_climate">contentious</a> 3,333 feet) and bohemian vibe. The double entendre makes
even more sense to me now that I’ve experienced the Andes, as you’ve got to
be in an altered frame of mind to consider the Appalachians high in
the mountains*. I have to tell y’all: because of the altitude, over the last month I tried no
less than three times to climb the Pichincha volcano outside of Quito.</p>

<p>Why three tries? This is what I know about the altitude here (courtesy of
Wikipedia, naturally):</p>

<ul>
<li>Our base camp, Quito, is located at 9,350 feet above sea level.</li>
<li>To start the ascent one must catch a gondola from Quito up the mountain
another 3,000 or so feet to 12,943 feet.</li>
<li>The summit of Pinchina is located at 15,696 feet above sea level: quite
the feat for someone prone to altitude sickness.</li>
</ul>

<p>The meadows, filled with scrubby alien plants seemingly better suited to
a desert than a volcano slope, were absolutely the highlight of our
hike. Craggy mountaintops piercing the clouds above our heads dwarved us
for much of the walk. At the summit, after a scramble up said crags
(actually hardened lava), we were rewarded with views of the volcano
below.</p>

helped plan our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=637562259600702&amp;set=a.243430865680512.67637.117154494974817&amp;type=1&amp;theater">start-of-office</a> immersion program, delivered <a href="https://twitter.com/fmrtn/status/364099758173868032">a presentation</a> on software testing <em>en Español</em> and visited
Mindo, a small town in the jungle about two hours outside of Quito.

<p>The content of this brand-new blog will likely touch on the
above-mentioned subjects (that is, a thrilling mix of hiking and software), but for now I&rsquo;ll leave y'all with a photo of the
park near my apartment, where I attempted my first-ever high-altitude run
this past weekend.
