    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I moved to Ecuador a few months ago I needed to learn Spanish quickly. Being surrounded by the language has been a great help; however, there are ways to fake
the immersion experience. I&rsquo;ve shared some of the tricks I used to learn
Spanish within my first month here.</p>

<p><strong>Start here: Duolingo</strong>
To improve quickly I needed to practice speaking with others, a terrifying prospect. I can&rsquo;t recommend <a href="http://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> highly enough, despite criticisms of its nonsensical phrases seemingly lacking real-world application*. The app&rsquo;s combination of drilling and silliness helped me overcome my fear of speaking Spanish with others.</p>

<p><strong>Think about it</strong>
It&rsquo;s said that dreaming in a language indicates fluency. Though I
haven&rsquo;t yet dreamt in Spanish, I&rsquo;m getting closer by forcing
translations of my thoughts.</p>

<p>Do I have a song in my head? Can I fumble through its translation, however rudimentary? Probably. When cooking, I translate the recipe in my while prepping the food. This gives me plenty of time to mull over potential translations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rose_gram" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p><strong>Google translate is your BFF</strong>
All those nerdy songs I was translating in my head? That time I didn&rsquo;t
know how to say <em>eggplant</em> in Spanish? I looked it up on Google
translate. Syntax-wise it&rsquo;s not perfect but I generally trust it for
single-word translations.</p>

<p><strong><em>El hombre-araña sube la rascacielo</em></strong>
Once I&rsquo;d learn a word I&rsquo;d force myself to use it in a sentence. Once again, the
sillier, the better: outlandish sayings stay in my head precisely because
they&rsquo;re different.</p>

<p><strong>Make it fun</strong>
I built a <a href="http://conjuegen-verbos.herokuapp.com/app/index.html#/verbos">quick Angular app</a> one day to quiz myself on translations. It didn&rsquo;t take much time to build and was fun to play with, and show off around the office, for an
afternoon. The more I incorporated Spanish into everyday activities the faster I reinforced vocabulary.</p>

<p><strong>Write it down!</strong>
I&rsquo;ve had plenty of opportunities to write emails in Spanish for work (with gratuitous
use of Google translate, of course). I&rsquo;d recommend just taking the time to write
something down in the language you&rsquo;re learning. It&rsquo;s another way to
practice using whole sentences and phrases with a real audience&mdash;
without the pressure of actually having to speak with that audience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/church_gram" /></p>

<p>As is the case with learning anything there&rsquo;s no substitute for practice. However, the tricks
I&rsquo;ve mentioned helped to make studying much more fun&mdash; and therefore,
easier.</p>

    <id>http://rebeccasliter.com/blog/2013/10/13/literally-wearing-many-hats</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we took a mountain-biking trip south of Quito, around
<a href="http://instagram.com/p/fGS_gSBEra/">Cotopaxí volcano</a>, ending up near a crater lake named Laguna Quilotoa. At times the temperature necessitated that I layer alpaca-wool hats in order to
not DIE OF FROSTBITE.</p>

<p><img src="/images/quilotoa_hats.jpg" /></p>

<p>Speaking of acclimation, or lack thereof, a funny thing&rsquo;s been happening
lately. In the States, travel during the workweek rendered
home-cooking impractical: it didn&rsquo;t feel right to do a huge grocery
order on a Friday evening knowing: A) that I&rsquo;d be flying Sunday afternoon, and B)
there was a Thai restaurant on the first floor of my apartment. Naturally, I elected to eat my way through the neighborhood&rsquo;s Yelp rankings, occasionally seeking out <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/hipster-history-of-gentrification-bohemians-logan-square/Content?oid=11117198">further-flung restaurants</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, we&rsquo;re living here, in the same place, and in the same apartment: a
novelty for the two of us. We&rsquo;re taking advantage of this and
cooking pretty frequently. The funny thing about this? Turns out that we cook
exactly what we ordered at restaurants: pad thai and Spanish ham plates,
complicated pastas and <a href="/blog/2013/09/29/by-the-numbers">tacos</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lilies_at_home.jpg" /></p>

<p>The best part of cooking at home is a weekly trip to Iñaquitos, a nearby market. Before going, we&rsquo;ll decide what we want to eat for the week and draw up a list: exactly the sort of ritual I was starving for during those blink-and-you&rsquo;ll-miss-it Chicago weekends.</p>

<p>Navigating Iñaquitos is another story entirely. The price of ingredients,
for example, has dropped significantly as I learn to correctly
speak Spanish outside of our office. Time in the market has also decreased as we&rsquo;ve
realized which vendors consistently stock the freshest produce. The
reward? Weekly flowers on our way out of the market, another thing I&rsquo;m
enjoying being in one place long enough to enjoy.</p>

We&rsquo;ve taken advantage of minor illness and <a href="/blog/2013/09/27/programacion-funcional-con-scala/">general busy-ness</a> to stick close to our home base and explore Quito. Hopefully soon we&rsquo;ll venture a little further outside the city but it&rsquo;s been a treat to explore all the churches, outdoor activities, and pastries Quito has to offer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/pinchincha_welcome.jpg" /></p>

<p>I remember one the outdoor companies in my college town had a slogan,
“Get High in the Mountains,” ostensibly owing to both the altitude
(a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone,_North_Carolina#Geography_and_climate">contentious</a> 3,333 feet) and bohemian vibe. The double entendre makes
even more sense to me now that I’ve experienced the Andes, as you’ve got to
be in an altered frame of mind to consider the Appalachians high in
the mountains*. I have to tell y’all: because of the altitude, over the last month I tried no
less than three times to climb the Pichincha volcano outside of Quito.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="/images/pinchincha_path.jpg" /></p>

<p>Why three tries? This is what I know about the altitude here (courtesy of
Wikipedia, naturally):</p>

<ul>
<li>Our base camp, Quito, is located at 9,350 feet above sea level.</li>
<li>To start the ascent one must catch a gondola from Quito up the mountain
another 3,000 or so feet to 12,943 feet.</li>
<li>The summit of Pinchina is located at 15,696 feet above sea level: quite
the feat for someone prone to altitude sickness.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/pinchincha_grass.jpg" />
<img src="/images/pinchincha_flowers.jpg" />
<img src="/images/pinchincha_flower2.jpg" /></p>

<p>The meadows, filled with scrubby alien plants seemingly better suited to
a desert than a volcano slope, were absolutely the highlight of our
hike. Craggy mountaintops piercing the clouds above our heads dwarved us
for much of the walk. At the summit, after a scramble up said crags
(actually hardened lava), we were rewarded with views of the volcano
below.</p>
